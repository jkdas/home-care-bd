                <h1 className="text-center my-4">Our Goals</h1>
                <p className="p-4 my-4">We are a small family owned and operated business.
                    We have been in business since 2005.
                    We are State licensed and Medicare certified.
                    We do through background screening of our staff including previous work history checks, criminal background checks, child abuse clearance checks and drug abuse tests when warranted.
                    Our staff is actually hired employees they are not contracted out from other agencies.
                    We have insurances in place for our employees to protect clients from any liabilities.
                    We allow our employees to participate in making out their schedules. This provides for flex-scheduling for them.
                    We provide private duty nursing care which means, for employees, they can provide one-on-one care to their patient at a more comfortable pace instead of trying to care for multiple patients during their shift.
                    We strive to provide competent, compassionate care.</p>
